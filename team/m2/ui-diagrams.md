## Explore Page

![Explore Page](Images/ExplorePage.png)

### Description of the Explore Page
The **explore page** is the compilation of all items listed on our website. You will have a few items that are recommended for you at the top of the page based on past views, past purchases, and filters. Below that will be all other listings that will by default be filtered by most popular, but we have a sort-by option to specify how you want the listings to appear. Along with the sort by, you can also filter using the search bar for keywords to get the items you desire.
1. **Search and filtering:** You will be able to explore items that you want by searching for keywords, filtering by many filters such as popularity, distance, price, and relevancy. These will change the types of listings that will appear below on the page

2. **Listings:** The listings are a scrollable feature that users can browse through to explore possible items they are interested in. You can see a small picture of the item with the price and description, and if you were to click on it, it would bring you to that item's page listed above. Along with this, on the bottom, there is a recently viewed tab for the items you have just viewed.

3. **Use Case:** This will be the main part of the app, where the buyers can browse items. They can view all available listings nearby, and filter by their needs. This allows for a successful and compact place to view items that are typically spread around the UMass Snapchat story and other sources around campus. It will be an easy place for buyers to come and find items they need.

## Profile Page

### Description of the Profile Page
- The user can acces to the profile page by clicking on the button available on the top right corner.
- The Profile Page will display key information about the seller or buyer. It will feature a minimal yet intuitive design, showing the user's profile picture at the top, followed by their name, and bio. It will also contain tabs or sections to navigate between active listings (for sellers) or purchase history (for buyers).
- Sellers can update their listings, view ratings, and respond to messages, while buyers can track orders and leave feedback. Users can also edit their profile details. If accessed without login, the system redirects to the login page, ensuring secure access.

## Item Page

![Item Page]()

### Description of the Item Page
The **Item page** will display our sellers' listings and allow buyers to browse items they are interested in. It is a minimalistic page with the title of the item, pictures of the items viewable by clicking through the middle, and more specifics on the details.
1. **Viewing of the item** - The user should be able to see multiple pictures of the item they are interested in by scrolling through the images uploaded by the seller including a big title above. The pictures are the main attraction of this page and we want the user to be able to view them easily both on the web and phone.

2. **Specific description of the item:** The page will include everything the user needs to know such as location, price, details about the seller, and a description of the item. These will be set by the seller, and the rating will be from the sellers page. The description will also be given from the seller with any further context needed.

3. **Message and save items:** These buttons will be available for the user to save items to their "Cart". and message the seller for buying details or more questions about the item. This will work very similar to Facebook marketplace, or any other swap app where we won't deal with the transaction but instead allow the buyer and seller to coordinate a time, place, and way of money transaction.

4. **Use Cases:** The use case for the item page is to engage the buyer with an item, get them more details, and connect them with the seller if they are interested in buying. It will allow for a deeper insight into the item so the buyer can be more assured they are getting the product they desire.
