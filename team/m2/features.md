# Application Features 
Here we outline a list of the key features of our application with a brief description of its purpose. We also assign roles to each team member to implement during the next milestone.

### 1. User Profiles
To allow students to buy and sell different items using our application we will require all users to log in using a profile that they will create. Once logged in users will be able to use the application to buy and sell items on campus. Users will be able to toggle between a buyer and seller profile. Within the buyer profile, people can view a buyer's contact information, purchase history, and view their location on campus. Within the seller profile, reviews and descriptions of items being sold will be displayed to the public. There will also be private features in the seller profile such as a tracker to log transactions and monitor profits and sales.

This feature will make sure users are authenticated when buying and selling. In addition, it allows users to keep track of sales that they made and can also help connect different buyers and sellers based on location.

### 2. Explore Page
The explore page is where users will be able to view and search for products that they are interested in. We will have three main components on this page: item pages, a search bar, and suggestions.

Upon entering the explore page, a user will see a search bar and an organized grid of item pages each displaying the item name, item price, seller location and part of the items' description. Upon clicking on an item page, the full description can be viewed along with the other information about price and seller. From there, users will be able to message a seller to ask for further information about a product or set up a time for the transaction to occur. 

From the explore page, a search bar will be provided for users to directly search for items that users want to purchase. Upon entering the name of an item, all items pages with items that match the specified name will be displayed. There will also be filters that the users can use to help filter down search results based on item category, seller location on campus, price and much more.

In addition to a search bar, we will also provide suggestions to the user on what items that they might be interested in based on previous purchases. 

This feature will help users to narrow down user searches so that they can more efficiently find items they are interested.

### 3. In-App Messaging
Users will be able to access an in-app messaging system through their profiles. They will be able to connect with different users to make purchase requests or even just ask further questions about an item that they may be interested in purchasing. 

This in-app messaging system will allow for easy communication between users in order to complete a purchase or learn more about an item or product being sold.

### 4. Notifications and Alerts
Once a purchase request is made by a buyer, the seller will receive a notification or alert that some message was sent. Buyers will also receive notifications that messages were sent to them from the seller. These notifications and alerts can be customized by users based on their preferences for receiving updates.

This feature will allow for more effective and efficient communication so that items can be more easily sold and bought on campus.

### 6. User Achievements and Badges
Upon the completion of certain "challenges" (such as listing 10 products), users can complete achievements to receive badges that can be displayed on their profile. These challenges will consist of non-monetary related activities such as counting the number of items listed or sold, interacting with a certain number of profiles or utilizing different features of the application.

This feature will be used to encourage users to engage more with the site for buying and selling items.
