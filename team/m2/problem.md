# Problem Description: 
### Clearly state the problem your target users face. Why is this a relevant or important issue? Describe the real-world impact of the problem and the pain points your users experience.

<!-- - College students have a lot of clutter, victims of impulse buying
- Have places like Snap Story where people do post items they are selling/looking to get rid of but can be overflowed with other irrelevant posts so sometimes aren't seen unless people look throught the entire post
    - also across different 
- Nathan's perspective: going around farmer's market, not knowing what to expect and eventually leaving with nothing, wasting time -->

As college students, we are limited in the amount of stuff we bring to campus and look for ways to relieve ourselves of unnecesarry items that clutter our dorms or apartments. It can be difficult at times to find someone to sell our used items to within close proximity (preferably around campus). There are ways students have found to get around this like posting on the campus SnapChat story but that is usually overloaded by irrelevant posts or limited by people who consistently use it so it can be inefficient at times. This issue goes the same way from the buyer persepctive where students might be interested in certain used items but have no good way of searching if it is being offered up by another student.

Additionally, with the buyer-seller interaction in mind, we also wanted to address an issue with the student and local farmers markets. There may be times where students want to check out what's at the farmers markets but have no clue what to expect. Yes, that's the fun of it but it takes time and effort to check and it's even worse when you end up finding nothing interesting. Unless the individual stands has some social media presence (which some do but not all), there is no convenient and centralized braway of finding out what is being sold or advertising their merchandise.


# Proposed Solution: 
### Detail how your web application will address the problem. What features or functionalities will your application include to help solve the issue? The solution should be directly tied to the problem, demonstrating a clear benefit to the users.

- Close the distance by focusing on local sellers/buyers (within a certain radius that is at the veyr least walkable)
- Allow students to search and explore what items are available and ones that might be of interest to them (filtering with tags, etc.)
- Create connections between buyer and seller with direct messaging
- Advertisement and profiles for farmers market sellers

# Why This Matters: 
### Explain the importance of solving this problem. How will solving this issue improve the lives or experiences of your target users? This section helps justify the need for your application and sets the stage for its development.

- Allow students to form new connections and
