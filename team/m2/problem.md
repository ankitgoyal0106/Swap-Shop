# Problem Description: 
### Clearly state the problem your target users face. Why is this a relevant or important issue? Describe the real-world impact of the problem and the pain points your users experience.

<!-- - College students have a lot of clutter, victims of impulse buying
- Have places like Snap Story where people do post items they are selling/looking to get rid of but can be overflowed with other irrelevant posts so sometimes aren't seen unless people look throught the entire post
    - also across different 
- Nathan's perspective: going around farmer's market, not knowing what to expect and eventually leaving with nothing, wasting time -->

As college students, we are limited in the amount of stuff we bring to campus and look for ways to relieve ourselves of unnecesarry items that clutter our dorms or apartments. It can be difficult at times to find someone to sell our used items to within close proximity (preferably around campus). There are ways students have found to get around this like posting on the campus SnapChat story but that is usually overloaded by irrelevant posts or limited by people who consistently use it so it can be inefficient at times. This issue goes the same way from the buyer persepctive where students might be interested in certain used items but have no good way of searching if it is being offered up by another student.

Additionally, with the buyer-seller interaction in mind, we also wanted to address an issue with the student and local farmers markets. There may be times where students want to check out what's at the farmers markets but have no clue what to expect. Yes, that's the fun of it but it takes time and effort to check and it's even worse when you end up finding nothing interesting. Unless the individual stands has some social media presence (which some do but not all), there is no convenient and centralized way of finding out what is being sold or advertising their merchandise.


# Proposed Solution: 
### Detail how your web application will address the problem. What features or functionalities will your application include to help solve the issue? The solution should be directly tied to the problem, demonstrating a clear benefit to the users.
<!-- - Close the distance by focusing on local sellers/buyers (within a certain radius that is at the veyr least walkable)
- Allow students to search and explore what items are available and ones that might be of interest to them (filtering with tags, etc.)
- Create connections between buyer and seller with direct messaging
- Advertisement and profiles for farmers market sellers -->
Our web application, Swap Shop, will include features such as:
 - Customizable buyer/seller profiles that will serve as their main hub, showing a user's current listings, past transaction history, and reviews from buyers. 
    - These can be student profiles owned by an independent individual or a profile used for a local business such as those farmer market stands
 - Direct messaging to allow buyers and sellers to communicate and connect with one another in order to come to an agreement on exchanges or sales
 - An explore page which will allow users to see what items are being sold on the market by other students and local sellers. Users will be able to search and filter for specific items they are interested in and are free to browse items presented to them on their explore page.

# Why This Matters: 
### Explain the importance of solving this problem. How will solving this issue improve the lives or experiences of your target users? This section helps justify the need for your application and sets the stage for its development.

Swap Shop aims to close the distance and strengthen the connection of local buyers and sellers, specifically college students to other college students as well as to small local businesses. We believe that increasing accessibility and exposure through our platform will streamline the exchange process in order to give both parties what they want. For sellers, it will give them the presence they need to find their potential buyers and advertise their items to a larger audience. And for buyers, it will allow them to search across a wide variety of items they might be interested in or desparately need. Our goal with Swap Shop is to cement the buyer-seller relationship by connecting users to one another who have similar interests in hopes of building relationsips that span beyond a simple one-time transaction.
