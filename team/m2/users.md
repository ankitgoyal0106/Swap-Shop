A markdown file that explains your target users and their specific needs.

SwapShop aims to bridge the gap between local buyers and sellers. The target users of this application are students at UMass and farmers' market and local vendors. The lack of an efficient and centralized system leads to frustration when trying to sell or buy used items as vendors struggle to advertise their offerings to the student population and miss out on opportunities to attract potential buyers. Students either hold onto items they no longer need or miss out on items they could have purchased from peers at a reasonable price. This disconnect between local sellers and students leads to lost sales and lower foot traffic at markets

We aim to solve this problem by providing a streamlined marketplace for local buying and selling with the following features:

- Customizable Profiles for Buyers and Sellers
- Direct Messaging
- Explore Page with Search Capability
- Advertising

Addressing the problems identified in both the student marketplace and local vendor ecosystems will greatly benefit our target users, as SwapShop will eliminate the inefficiency of current methods and provide a simple and reliable way to declutter dorms by selling used items or finding affordable secondhand goods. It will also help foster stronger connections between students who share similar buying and selling interests.

For Local Vendors/Farmers' Markets, the platform will give small vendors the exposure they need to attract more buyers. By compiling the information on whatâ€™s available at the market, vendors can better engage with their community and increase sales.
