SwapShop aims to bridge the gap between local buyers and sellers. The target users of this application are students at UMass and farmers' market and local vendors. The lack of an efficient and centralized system leads to frustration when trying to sell or buy used items as vendors struggle to advertise their offerings to the student population and miss out on opportunities to attract potential buyers. Students either hold onto items they no longer need or miss out on items they could have purchased from peers at a reasonable price. This disconnect between local sellers and students leads to lost sales and lower foot traffic at markets

We aim to solve this problem by providing a streamlined marketplace for local buying and selling with the following features:

- Customizable Profiles for Buyers and Sellers
- Direct Messaging
- Explore Page with Search Capability
- Advertising

Addressing the problems identified in both the student marketplace and local vendor ecosystems will greatly benefit our target users, as SwapShop will eliminate the inefficiency of current methods and provide a simple and reliable way to declutter dorms by selling used items or finding affordable secondhand goods. It will also help foster stronger connections between students who share similar buying and selling interests.

For Local Vendors/Farmers' Markets, the platform will give small vendors the exposure they need to attract more buyers. By compiling the information on whatâ€™s available at the market, vendors can better engage with their community and increase sales.

MILESTONE #3:
The features we have implemented in the front-end align with the profile we have established above. We have made a direct messaging page, an explore page with search capability, and profiles for buyers and sellers. Apart from this, we have also identified how to make the UI for the pages functional and useful to the users by making it visually straightforward and compatible on multiple screen sizes. The Explore page, for example, includes a robust filtering system that allows users to narrow down results by item category, condition, location, and price range, ensuring they can find exactly what they're looking for. The create items page includes specific fields for item details, including location, price, and condition (new or used), allowing sellers to provide key information upfront. This reduces the need for back-and-forth messaging and helps buyers make quicker decisions. We are implementing a notification system so important communications don't go unnoticed.

Through these improvements, we are confident that the SwapShop application addresses the core needs of students and vendors to curate a streamlined and user-centric marketplace experience.
