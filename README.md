# Overview

Swap Shop is a web application designed to connect college students with each other and with local businesses, such as farmer's market vendors, to facilitate the exchange of goods. It addresses the challenges students face when buying or selling used items on campus and provides a more efficient alternative to existing platforms like campus Snapchat stories. Additionally, it offers an organized space for local businesses to advertise their products, enhancing the connection between students and the local community.

# Problem Statement

College students have limited space in dorms and apartments and often look for ways to declutter by selling unnecessary items. However, finding nearby buyers or sellers, especially within campus proximity, can be challenging. Existing solutions, such as campus Snapchat stories, are cluttered with irrelevant posts, making it difficult to connect with the right audience efficiently.

Similarly, students may be interested in visiting local farmers' markets but find it inconvenient to discover what is being offered in advance, leading to wasted time. Not all vendors have a social media presence, and there is no centralized platform to showcase their merchandise.

Swap Shop addresses these issues by creating a seamless platform where students and local sellers can easily buy, sell, or exchange items.
